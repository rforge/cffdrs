Description: This project provides a group of new functions to calculate the outputs of the two main components of the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System (CFFDRS) at various time scales (e.g. daily and hourly): the Fire Weather Index (FWI) System and the Fire Behaviour Prediction (FBP) System. A few of the functions have two versions, the spreadsheet- and raster- based.
